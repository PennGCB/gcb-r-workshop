# A Gentle Guide to the Grammar of Graphics with `ggplot2`

Adapted from <https://github.com/gadenbuie/gentle-ggplot2>. Rest of README has
not yet been changed.

The slides are available here: <https://gadenbuie.github.io/gentle-ggplot2>

## Follow Along

You can use the script [`0-companion-script.R`](0-companion-script.R) to follow along during the talk or to review the plots later.

## Setup

You only need to install the following two packages (okay, one of them is the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org), so it's a bit more than just two packages).

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gapminder"))
```

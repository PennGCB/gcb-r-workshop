# GCB R workshop introduction


## TO-DO

+ [ ] Make initial todo-list, either here or in issues


## PREAMBLE

+ [ ] Write up the instruction about what students need to do before the workshop
+ [ ] Prepare a R markdown file with the following content
  + [ ] Install R and Rstudio
  + [ ] Install R packages necessary for this workshop
  + [ ] Helpful materials and references of R, for example, ggplot2 cheatsheet and best practices in visualization


## SESSION 1


## SESSION 2 

+  [ ] **R Markdown intro to data visualization with R**
> + [ ] Brief intro to ggplot2 (ggplot as an object you can add to, manipulate)
> + [ ] Why factors are useful (convoluted plot vs. plot where you've grouped things into factors)
> + [ ] Some cute plots to inspire us
+ [ ] **R Markdown intro to efficient data manipulation**
> + [ ]  Group_by / summarize / mutate
> + [ ]  Melt
> + [ ] Reordering levels of factors
+ [ ] **Practicum: Data Manipulation for Better Visualizations**
> + [ ] Find dataset that would lend itself to a heatmap, some kind of x, y plot like a scatter or boxplot, and which would benefit from faceting by a factor and/or a normalizing transformation  
> + [ ] Simple plot (scatter plot or boxplot) -- first without faceting, then with faceting (maybe introducing a factor using dplyr that we can facet by)
> + [ ] Melting to make a heatmap 
> + [ ] Reordering factors (we could do this on a boxplot or scatterplot easily too-- if we have them build a factor with levels "Low", "Medium", "High" and have to reorder form the default High, Low, Medium order (alphabetical))

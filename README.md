# GCB R workshop introduction

## PREAMBLE

+ [ ] **Instruction of preparation before the workshop**
> + [ ] Install R
> + [ ] Install Rstudio
> + [ ] Install required R packages for this workshop
> + [ ] Helpful materials and references of R, for example, r cheatsheet, ggplot2 cheatsheet and best practices in visualization

## Reminder

Each session contains R markdown files (basically a coding notebook), but of two version, the one with solution, and the one that does not. To fully take advantage of this workshop, we recommand working on the R markdown files that do not have solutions first so as to evaluate yourself for your understanding of the materials.

## SESSION 1

+ [ ] **Instruction to the basic R**
> + [ ] Intro to data types and structure of R
> + [ ] Intro to basic R data exploration/manipulation
> + [ ] Intro to basic R visualization (advanced functions will be available in session 2)
> + [ ] Logic control
> + [ ] How to write your own R function

## SESSION 2 

+  [ ] **Intro to data visualization with R**
> + [ ] Brief intro to ggplot2 (ggplot as an object you can add to, manipulate)
> + [ ] Why factors are useful (convoluted plot vs. plot where you've grouped things into factors)
> + [ ] Some cute plots to inspire us
+ [ ] **Intro to efficient data manipulation**
> + [ ] Group_by / summarize / mutate
> + [ ] Melt
> + [ ] Reordering levels of factors
+ [ ] **Practicum: Data Manipulation for Better Visualizations**
> + [ ] Find dataset that would lend itself to a heatmap, some kind of x, y plot like a scatter or boxplot, and which would benefit from faceting by a factor and/or a normalizing transformation  
> + [ ] Simple plot (scatter plot or boxplot) -- first without faceting, then with faceting (maybe introducing a factor using dplyr that we can facet by)
> + [ ] Melting to make a heatmap 
> + [ ] Reordering factors (we could do this on a boxplot or scatterplot easily too-- if we have them build a factor with levels "Low", "Medium", "High" and have to reorder form the default High, Low, Medium order (alphabetical))

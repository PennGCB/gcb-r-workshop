# Session 1

Session 1 is designed to take students that may have never seen R code in their lives and get them to a point that they are feel comfortable playing with some data and googling how to write code on their own fro GCB533 and potential rotation projects.

Session 1 has three Sections:

Section 1: The Basics
* We will start by going over the different data types and structure of R. We will also cover a number of commands to help make and manipulate the data objects in R.

Secton 2: Data Exploration and Visualization
* We will cover basic data science functions of R: How do I read and write files? How do I perform basic QC? How might I visualize these data? You will have some answers to these question at the end of this section! (We will cover a tiny bit of statistics too)

Section 3: Functions and For Loops
* We will cover how to write your own functions in R, and how the basic looping features of R work.
